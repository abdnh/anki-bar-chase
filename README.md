# Counter Bar

This add-on adds a top bar to the review screen with the following elements:

-   A repeating countdown timer with configurable time in the middle.
-   A counter on the left that starts from 0 and behaves like this:
    -   The counter goes up by 1 when you rate a card, suspend it, bury it or delete it.
    -   If the countdown timer ends and the counter is <= 0, the counter goes down by 1. If it's > 0, it resets to 0.
-   A counter on the right for the number of countdown loops passed in the current review session.
-   A progress bar indicating the countdown time. The bar will be red if the left-side counter is <= 0, green otherwise.
